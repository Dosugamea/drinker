## About drinker

**As first, this is first laravel project for me.
Maybe writing bad code but don't attack me. If you're enough kind, please make an issue with kind words.**

Drinker is a laravel web application for beverage review community.
The web app focus on japanese softdrink or juices, not liquors.

## Learning drinker

I have docs about this project but not final and won't get public until it's ready.

## Running drinker
Maybe it will released as docker container(?)
Currently, you need entire development environments to run.

## Drinkers Sponsors

Nobody. Could you be first sponser? XD

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the drinker! Unfortunately, I have not planning to get contributors for now! You can also send a pull request but I won't merge on this stage. As I said before, this project is for learning purposes. You can fork or make another project as you like still.

## Folder structures

This is not special. Basically this project using laravel starter.
Just added .devcontainer for use in vscode on windows.

## Security Vulnerabilities
This is for study purposes, and not for production.
I'll care about security but not 100% sure.
Be careful if you touch this project code!
